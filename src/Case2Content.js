          </div>
          <p>Coldcut Systems creates the Coldcut Cobra cutting extinguishers â€“ a unique product that enables fire fighters to extinguish fires from outside a burning structure. The extinguisher quickly cuts a hole in the wall and then sprays a high pressure water mist inside to cool the fire.
          <br />
          From the start I was tasked with designing a new web page but the scope later grew to including a new design direction for their entire brand.

            <div class="case-rule"></div>
            <h5>Process</h5>
          </div>

          <p>
          Early in the project we held a full day workshop with product experts from Coldcut Systems. Involving the client as much as possible is helpful in many ways; it gives me the understanding I need to design the right thing and it gives the client a sense of co-creation and participation. All the insights gathered during the workshop was then turned in to wireframe that was later approved by the client. Parallel to my design work Coldcut was developing text, image and video content for the site.
          <br />
          As the scope grew my initial focus shifted to finding a strong set of elements that would help Coldcut convey their products efficiently. The color palette is a development of their old colors and draws inspiration from fire fighting and heat vs cold. I enhanced the intensity of the colors since their products are used by fire fighters in emergencies where high visibility is a priority.
          <br />
          As the main font I choose Modern Era, which besides offering great legibility also conveys an aura of stability and precise engineering. I also added Foundry Gridnik as a decorative font that can be added as a graphical element. </p>

            <h5>Realisation</h5>
          </div>
          <p>By using strong colors and bold typography Coldcut now has a confident expression. The high visibility and utilitarian look of the identity fits well with the field in which they operate.
          <br />
          The web showcases the new identity, restructures the content and present Coldcuts products and services in a new way. The Method sections has been given extra care and demonstrates how to use Coldcut Cobra in 4 steps; Scan, Attack, Ventilate and Enter. By making the section interactive we are able the explain the process in an educational and exciting way.
